    <h1>Rank Correlation</h1>
    <p class="intro">Rank correlation, also known as non-parametric correlation, measures the degree of association between two variables based on the ranks of their values rather than their actual values. Rank correlation is often used when the data is not normally distributed or when the relationship between variables is non-linear. <br>Here are some common applications of rank correlation:</p>
    <h1><b>Applications of Rank Correlation</b></h1>
    <div class=app>
    <p><b>Medical Research:</b><br>

       <br>In clinical trials, researchers may use Spearman's rank correlation to assess the relationship between two variables, such as a patient's age and their response to a particular treatment. This is useful when the data is not normally distributed, or when the variables are measured on an ordinal scale.</p>
    <p> <b> Education Assessment:</b><br>

    <br></br>  In educational research, Spearman's rank correlation can be used to measure the relationship between students' rankings in different subjects. For example, it can help determine if there is a consistent pattern in how students perform across various subjects. </p>
    <p><b>Customer Satisfaction:</b><br></br>

      <br></br>  Rank correlation can be used to assess the agreement between customer rankings of products or services and their overall satisfaction.</p>
    <p><b>Consumer Surveys:</b><br></br>

      Rank correlation can be used to measure the association between consumer rankings of products or brands and their preferences.</p>
    <P><b>Social Surveys:</b><br></br>

      <br></br> Rank correlation can be used to assess the relationship between treatment groups and patient outcomes when the data may not follow a normal distribution.</p>
    <p><b>Psychology:</b><br></br>
